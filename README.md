# SnowAlbedoProcessingChain

This repository contains all code used to merge DJI flight logs with logs from the Meteon 2.0 datalogger, and for the preprocessing of imagery and irradiance data to be used in the generation of high resolution albedo surfaces.

Code for merging logs is contained in merge_data.py, and code for processing imagery is contained in image_processing.py. Currently, all other .py files are used as temporary development workspaces.
